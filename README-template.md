## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./Final_img/Finalized_work.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I started off initally drawing the whole site. I'd then outline sections that I think could be wrapped in a div or semantic HTML i.e main
header, or section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned using the <br> tag can be helpful to create how I want the new lines to look. It can also be another tool to use instead of having to shrink the content with margin, padding or width to have the text wrapped in a certain way.
I'm starting like the responsiveness of flexbox and how its a nice alternative instead of having to set a width. I want to start using flexbox more often.

**Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.- to be deleted**

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I think I've gotten close to this as possbile. And I want to avoid falling into the trap of having my work look pixel perfect to the original as it won't really help me that much in improving my skills overall.
