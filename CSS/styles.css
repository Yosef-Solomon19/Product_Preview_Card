    I was having a problem with the div that I was using for an img. 
    Everyting I was adding more space to margin right. Either the product section would cover the 
    image or the width of the image would shrink. 
    I wanted the image to not be affected. 
    
    What I tried: 
    I changed the div element containing the image to an image element. 
    That seemed to work to prevent the image from losing it size.*/
